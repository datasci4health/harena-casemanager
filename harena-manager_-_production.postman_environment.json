I am glad that you called me. Chest pain is an important complaint at the emergency department and we have to exclude the fatal causes: myocardial infarction (MI), acute aortic dissection (AAD), pulmonary embolism PE), hypertensive pneumothorax (HP), and Boerhaave Syndrome (BS).\n\nThe best way to find out what is happening with your patient, my young padawan, is to gather as much information as possible through history taking and physical examination. We need to search for the signs and symptoms that can guide our clinical reasoning process by changing the pre-test probabilities of each disease.\n::\n\n* See likelihood tables -> B \n\n### B (detailed)\n:SUPERVISOR Harry:.\n**Likelihood Tables**\n\nDo you know the concept of Likelihood ratio (LR)? -> Likelihood Ratio\n\n+ -> Clinical History Myocardial Infarction\n\n+ -> Physical Examination Myocardial Infarction\n\n+ -> Clinical History Aortic Dissection\n\n+ -> Physical Examination Aortic Dissection\n\n+ -> Pulmonary Embolism Wells Criteria\n\n* Continue talking -> C \n\n### C (detailed)\n:SUPERVISOR Harry:.\nHypertensive pneumothorax is more common in tall and thin young adults (primary pneumothorax) or in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases or chest trauma (secondary pneumothorax). On physical examination, we expect asymmetry in lung auscultation and the trachea may be dislocated to the contralateral side of the pneumothorax.\n\nBoerhaave Syndrome is more common in patients who presented vomiting before the chest pain started, were submitted to endoscopic procedures or had chest trauma.\n\nHow does this information can help you to solve your case?\n\n* Back to the case -> Cycle 1.Begin\n\n### Likelihood Ratio (note)\n\nLikelihood ratio (LR) - like sensitivity and specificity, LR describe the discriminatory power of features in a clinical context, estimating the probability of disease. When the LR is higher than 1, the feature increases the probability; when lower than 1, reduces it.\n\n* Back -> Supervisor B\n\n### Clinical History Myocardial Infarction (note)\n![Clinical History Myocardial Infarction](images/ebm-clinical-history-myocardial-infarction.png)\n\n* Back -> Supervisor B\n\n### Physical Examination Myocardial Infarction (note)\n![Physical Examination Myocardial Infarction](images/ebm-physical-examination-myocardial-infarction.png)\n\n* Back -> Supervisor B\n\n### Clinical History Aortic Dissection (note)\n![Clinical History Aortic Dissection](images/ebm-clinical-history-aortic-dissection.png)\n\n* Back -> Supervisor B\n\n### Physical Examination Aortic Dissection (note)\n![Physical Examination Aortic Dissection](images/ebm-physical-examination-aortic-dissection.png)\n\n* Back -> Call the supervisor B\n\n### Pulmonary Embolism Wells Criteria (note)\n![Pulmonary Embolism Wells Criteria](images/ebm-pulmonary-embolism-wells-criteria.png)\n\n* Back -> Call the supervisor B\n\nCheck hypothesis (selector)\n---------------------------\n\n:Jacinto:Let us check out your hypothesis.

Both features increases the probability of pericardial disease, especially acute pericarditis. Although patient´s father died of a \"heart attack\", there were no chest pain features that increase the probability of myocardial infarction, as the pain did not irradiate to arms, the pain was not described as a pressure, neither complaining about nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath. Another differential diagnosis to consider is myopericarditis, but we not be able to find heart failure signs (pulmonary and cardiac auscultation were normal) and the patient did not complain about dyspnea. So, at the level 1, the answer to our open-ended question was Acute Pericarditis.\n\n* Next -> Level 2.2a\n* Return -> Report\n\nLevel 2\n-------\n\n### 2a (detailed)\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px\">\n<b>Level 2</b>: At this level, we asked you to highlight in green all features that corroborate your hypothesis, in blue those are neutral and in red the ones speaking against your hypothesis.\n<br><br>\n<b>Your answer:</b>\n<br>\n{{player#Cycle_1.Check_hypothesis.symptoms: ,+,=,-\nNurse: Doctor, please you have to evaluate a {man(male)} ({51 years-old(aging=51)#=}) who entered the emergency department reporting {chest pain#=}.His vital signs are {ABP: 144x92mmHG#=}; {HR: 78bpm#=}; {RR: 21rpm#=}; {Temp: 37oC#=}; {O2Sat: 98%#=}.\n<br>\nPatient: Doctor, I am feeling chest pain since yesterday.

There is no vital signs features that increase the probability of this condition. Some patients may present fever and tachycardia, but it´s not common signs. So, when vital signs are normal, we cannot confirm or exclude this diagnosis.\n\nIn clinical history, two features increase the probability of the chest pain being related to a pericardial disease: worsening with breathing; and worsening when the patient lay down. \n\n* Next -> 2c\n* Return -> Final.Report\n\n### 2c (detailed)\n\nAs the patient has arterial hypertension, is smoker and his father died of a \"heart attack\" we could consider myocardial infarction as one of the diagnosis. But considering chest pain features of our patient, there is no one that increases this possibility. So, these features may lead us to cognitive error if we consider myocardial infarction as the main diagnosis (which is wrong). \n\nIn physical examination in patients with acute pericarditis, we may find pericardial rub, one of the diagnostic criteria. So, when we did not find it, the probability of the disease is reduced, but did not exclude the diagnosis. It is crucial to look for the other diagnostic criteria.\n\n* Next -> Level 3.3a\n* Return -> Final.Report\n\nLevel 3\n-------\n\n### 3a (detailed)\n\nMy young Dr, the EKG interpretation was very helpful to solve our case.\n\nWe found a diffuse ST-segment elevation, and a PR-segment depression in DII lead.  These findings, associated to the clinical scenario, strongly indicate the main hypothesis of Acute Pericarditis.\n\n* Next -> 3b\n* Return -> Final.Report\n\n### 3b (detailed)\n\nMy young Dr, the EKG interpretation was very helpful to solve our case.\n\nWe found a diffuse ST-segment elevation, and a PR-segment depression in DII lead.
